    Adapted from https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torchvision/transforms/functional.html#normalize

    Normalize a tensor image with mean and standard deviation.

    .. note::
        This transform acts out of place by default, i.e., it does not mutates the input tensor.

    See :class:`~torchvision.transforms.Normalize` for more details.

    Args:
        tensor (Tensor): Tensor image of size (C, H, W) to be normalized.
        mean (sequence): Sequence of means for each channel.
        std (sequence): Sequence of standard deviations for each channel.
        inplace(bool,optional): Bool to make this operation inplace.

    Returns:
        Tensor: Normalized Tensor image.
